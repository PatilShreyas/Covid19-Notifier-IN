## About
- It simply loads **Total COVID19 cases in India** from [API](https://github.com/covid19india/api).
- It notifies total cases of COVID19 in India after every 1 hours.
- It shows the total cases of the District from every State.
- Dark mode too üåó.
- It is offline capable (Using Cache) üòÉ.

*It uses `PeriodicWorkManager` which is scheduled at the first run of an app. After that, `Worker` will execute after every one hour of interval and will show notification on Android's system tray.*

## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Koin](https://start.insert-koin.io/) - Dependency Injection Framework (Kotlin)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Moshi Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/moshi) - A Converter which uses Moshi for serialization to and from JSON.
- [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - The WorkManager API makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or device restarts.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android
